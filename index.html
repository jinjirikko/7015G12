        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Located on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula, Malacca is an important gateway to the Strait of Malacca and has been one of the most important trading ports in Southeast Asia since ancient times. Its development has spanned several important historical stages, reflecting rich cultural integration and power changes.</p>
        <p>Malacca was originally established around 1400 by Parameswara, a prince from Sumatra. Under his rule, Malacca quickly developed into a powerful maritime kingdom and established close diplomatic and trade relations with the Ming Dynasty of China. The Malacca Sultanate was not only a commercial center, but also a key town for the spread of Islam in the Malay Archipelago.</p>
        <p>In 1511, the Portuguese Afonso de Albuquerque captured Malacca, ushering in a four-century colonial rule in Malacca. In 1641, the Dutch succeeded the Portuguese as rulers and promoted the development of the city's architecture and administrative system. From 1795, Britain gradually took over Malacca. The official colonization began after the Anglo-Dutch Treaty in 1824.</p>
        <p>During World War II, Malacca was occupied by Japan and returned to Britain after the war. In 1957, Malaya (now Malaysia) became independent and Malacca became one of the thirteen states of Malaysia. In 2008, Malacca was listed as a World Cultural Heritage City by UNESCO for its unique historical value and multicultural heritage.</p>
