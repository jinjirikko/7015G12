        <p>Period: 15th Century (reconstructed in 1984)</p>
<p>Architectural Style: Traditional Malay Palace Architecture (wooden, no nails used)</p>

<p>Brief Description:
This museum is a replica of the palace of Sultan Mansur Shah, who ruled Melaka from 1456 to 1477. It was reconstructed based on historical records from the Malay Annals (Sejarah Melayu). The wooden structure is elevated on stilts, with sweeping gabled roofs and intricate carvings. Inside, it showcases the glory of the Melaka Sultanate, displaying royal regalia, weaponry, traditional costumes, dioramas of court ceremonies, and models of diplomatic missions. It offers a vivid insight into Melaka’s golden age before colonial rule.</p>

        <h2>Church of Saint Paul</h2>
        <p>Period: Portuguese Period (built in 1521)</p>
<p>Architectural Style: Early Colonial Portuguese ecclesiastical architecture</p>
<p>Brief Description:
Originally called “Nossa Senhora da Annunciada” (Our Lady of the Annunciation), this church was built by Portuguese nobleman Duarte Coelho. It became a key religious site and was later converted into a burial ground by the Dutch for their nobility. Today, it is a haunting and iconic ruin located on St. Paul’s Hill, offering panoramic views of the city and sea. Visitors can still see the tombstones with Dutch inscriptions and the statue of St. Francis Xavier, who once used the church for his missionary work in Asia.</p>

 <p>Architectural Style: Dutch colonial with red façade, louvered windows, and massive doors</p>
 <p>Brief Description:
Built as the official residence of the Dutch Governor and administrative center, the Stadthuys is one of the oldest Dutch buildings in the East.

        <h2>Queen Victoria Fountain</h2>
        <p>Period: British Colonial Period (1901)</p>
        <p>Architectural Style: Edwardian commemorative fountain</p>
        <p>Brief Description: Erected by the British community in Melaka to honor the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria’s reign (1837–1901), this fountain is located in Dutch Square. Though modest in scale, it is a fine example of colonial civic architecture, with Victorian motifs and inscriptions. The fountain remains fully functional and serves as a historical centerpiece between the Stadthuys and Christ Church. It symbolizes British influence in Melaka during the late colonial period.</p>

        <p>Period: Historical roots since the Dutch era; evolved into a multicultural hub</p>
        <p>Architectural Style: Eclectic mix – Straits Chinese (Peranakan), colonial shophouses</p>
        <p>Brief Description: Once known for antique dealers, Jonker Street is now a lively cultural hotspot, especially during weekend night markets. The street is lined with heritage shophouses displaying a blend of Chinese, Dutch, and Malay architectural influences, many dating back to the 17th century. It's famous for Peranakan cuisine (like chicken rice balls and Nyonya laksa), local crafts, fashion boutiques, and street performances. The street is a living example of Melaka’s multicultural identity, where Chinese clan houses, Hindu temples, and mosques coexist in close proximity.</p>
